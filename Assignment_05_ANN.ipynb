He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple, Samsung etc. He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market, you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem, he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies. Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone (eg:- RAM, Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. Create an artificial neural network-based classifier to help Bob. Data and class labels are available in mobile_price_classification.csv file. Use price_range column as label and remaining columns as data.\n","Also do the hyperparmeter tuning.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"h__c7Xs6lQk9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#1.Data loading and pre-processing\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"n-mcaetylg8s"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"Y92qRQ58lIjw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1752746985981,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2729,"user":{"displayName":"reshma mathew","userId":"05942989648898463442"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\n","\n","# Load the dataset\n","df = pd.read_csv('/content/mobile_price_classification.csv')\n","\n","# Separate features (X) and labels (y)\n","X = df.drop('price_range', axis=1)\n","y = df['price_range']\n","\n","# Scale the features\n","scaler = StandardScaler()\n","X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n","\n","# Split the data into training and testing sets\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#2.
